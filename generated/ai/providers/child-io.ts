/**
 * Stdio guards for the JSONL/JSON-RPC child processes the AI providers drive.
 *
 * Both `PiProcessNode` (pi-sdk-node.ts) and `CodexAppServerProcess`
 * (codex-app-server.ts) talk to a nested agent over pipes, and a pipe can
 * break at any instant — the child exits, is killed, or closes stdin while a
 * command is in flight. Two Node behaviors turn that ordinary condition into
 * a host-killing crash:
 *
 *  1. `stream.write()` on a broken pipe reports `EPIPE` either synchronously
 *     (throw) or asynchronously (an `error` event on the stream), and which
 *     one you get is a timing race. A `destroyed` check before the write
 *     cannot close that race: the child can close the pipe between the check
 *     and the write.
 *  2. An `error` event on a Node stream (or on the `ChildProcess` itself)
 *     with NO listener is re-thrown as an `uncaughtException`. Inside an
 *     embedded extension that is not "the provider failed" — it terminates
 *     the HOST agent process.
 *
 * That is issue #1378: a Plannotator plan review opened from Pi on Windows
 * took the whole Pi host down with `write EPIPE` out of `PiProcessNode.send()`.
 * Windows only made it likelier to land on the async path during teardown;
 * the mechanism is platform-independent.
 *
 * The contract these helpers enforce: a broken pipe is a PROVIDER failure.
 * It never escalates past the provider, it is reported exactly like any other
 * process end (in-flight requests reject, listeners see the process end), and
 * the provider is left dead so the next query re-spawns it.

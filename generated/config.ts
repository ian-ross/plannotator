// several Plannotator processes (an annotate session and a review session at
// once is ordinary). Two of them settling a POST /api/config in the same
// window both read the pre-change file, both merge onto it, and the second
// write silently drops the first writer's key while both callers are told the
// save succeeded. An advisory lockfile makes the read-merge-write a critical
// section across processes.
//
// Advisory, bounded, and never fatal, in that order of priority:
//  - O_EXCL create of `${configDir}/config.json.lock` is the only primitive
//    required, so this stays node:fs-only and portable to every runtime that
//    vendors this file (no flock, no native deps, no fcntl semantics).
//  - A lock whose mtime is older than the stale window is assumed to belong
//    to a process that died holding it and is taken over. Holding the lock
//    spans one read plus one write, i.e. microseconds, so a lock this old is
//    not a live writer.
//  - Waiting is bounded by the wait budget. When the budget runs out the
//    write proceeds unlocked with a warning: a lost update is a bad outcome,
//    a server wedged forever on a lockfile is a worse one.
//
// Residual failure mode, stated plainly: two writers that both judge the same
// lock stale in the same instant can both take it, and one update is lost
// exactly as it was before. That needs a >1.5s stall inside a critical
// section that costs microseconds, and the cost of closing it (owner tokens,
// re-verification, a second lock) is not worth paying for a settings file.

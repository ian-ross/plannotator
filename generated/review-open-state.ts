/**
 * Pure validation for the `plannotator review --base <ref>` / `--diff-type <id>`
 * open-state flags. Everything here is decision logic with no git and no
 * server, so the whole provider/PR/workspace matrix is testable in isolation
 * and shared verbatim by the CLI, the opencode-review bridge, the OpenCode
 * plugin, and the Pi extension (vendored).
 *
 * The flags are a per-invocation SEED, never a setting: callers thread the
 * resolved `requestedBase` / `requestedDiffType` into `prepareLocalReviewDiff`
 * and nothing here (or downstream) writes a persisted preference.

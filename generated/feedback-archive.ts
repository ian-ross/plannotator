/**
 * Feedback Archive — durable local storage of every submitted review.
 *
 * Plannotator's decision paths hand the user's feedback to the invoking agent
 * and then forget it: code review persisted nothing at all, plan decisions
 * only landed in `plans/` while the client-side planSave setting was on (and
 * overwrote the previous decision for the same slug), and the annotate
 * surfaces only kept the #678 record for single local files. This module is
 * the one place all of those write a durable, analyzable record of what the
 * user actually submitted.
 *
 * Layout (per project, mirroring the `history/` project convention):
 *
 *   {DATA_DIR}/feedback/{project}/index.jsonl      append-only, authoritative
 *   {DATA_DIR}/feedback/{project}/records/…​.md      human-readable sidecar
 *
 * The JSONL line is self-contained: an analyzer never has to open a sidecar.
 * The sidecar exists because everything else in the data dir is markdown and
 * users grep it; it is written only for records that carry content (a bare
 * approval or a dismissal is a decision-only line).
 *
 * SHARED INDEX, not a Plannotator-private store. Several tools that share this
 * data dir append to the SAME `feedback/{project}/index.jsonl`, distinguished
 * by the `client` field on every line rather than by separate files. Known
 * writers: `plannotator` (this module) and `plannotator-tui`, the Rust
 * terminal client; `herdr-annotate` is reserved for a possible future Lite
 * writer. A record's meaning is the same whoever wrote it, so an analyzer
 * reads one file, sorts by `ts`, and filters by `client` only when it actually
 * cares who submitted. Consequences worth respecting when changing this file:
 * the line shape is a cross-tool contract (fields are added, never
 * repurposed), other clients suffix their id onto their sidecar filenames
 * (`{stamp}-{surface}-{decision}-plannotator-tui.md`), and unknown fields must
 * be ignored rather than rejected.
 *
 * Contract, shared with `persistAnnotateSubmission` (#678):
 *  - This module NEVER throws. Any failure is logged once and reported as
 *    `null`, so a full disk can never turn a reviewer's submit into a 500.
 *  - Callers append BEFORE deleting the reviewer's draft: a failed archive
 *    write leaves the draft behind as the recovery copy.
 *  - The data directory is resolved PER CALL (not captured at module load
 *    like storage.ts does), so a test can redirect PLANNOTATOR_DATA_DIR
 *    inside the test body — Bun runs every test file in one process, and a
 *    module-load capture cannot be redirected without import-order games.
 *
 * Runtime-agnostic: node:fs / node:path only, so Pi vendors it unmodified.

/**
 * Reply threading (`inReplyTo`) rules shared by every consumer: the feedback
 * export, the annotations panel, and the external-annotation ingest.
 *
 * Browser-safe, zero-dep. `inReplyTo` is an additive field whose value can
 * come from anywhere (a browser agent's tool call, a PATCH on
 * /api/external-annotations that merges arbitrary fields), so consumers must
 * never trust it to form a tree. The one rule every consumer applies:
 *
 *   An annotation is a reply only when its `inReplyTo` names a DIFFERENT
 *   annotation in the same list AND following the chain of parents never
 *   comes back to the annotation itself. Everything else is a root: a plain
 *   comment, an orphan whose parent is absent, a self-reference, and every
 *   member of a cycle. Roots keep their original order. A reply to a cycle
 *   member stays a reply: its parent is rendered (as a root).
 *
 * Consequence: no annotation is ever dropped from a threaded rendering, and
 * a reply always hangs under something that is itself rendered.
 *
 * Every walk here is linear in the number of annotations: each id is
 * classified once and later chains stop at the first classified id, so a
 * 5,000-deep chain (which a hostile or buggy tool can POST) costs 5,000
 * steps, not 12.5 million.
